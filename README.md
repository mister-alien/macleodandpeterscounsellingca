I take the approach that you are the expert on your life and I possess the tools necessary to help you in your therapeutic journey. I consider counselling a team effort and I am looking forward to having a new team member.

My primary focus in my practice is ADHD, and anxiety. I also have experience working with people with depression, OCD, and high functioning autism.
Recognizing that you want to take steps forward in improving your life is huge. I want to assist you in taking some of the next steps in your counselling journey.
